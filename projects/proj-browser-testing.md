### Browser Testing

At Sparkbox, we don't have [Quality Assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance#Software_development), so we usually do our own browser testing.

#### Gold Level Support
In these browsers, behavior & design are strong representations of design intent. A user is able to access all content and functionality as described.

macOS
- Safari 9+ (latest subversion)
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)

Windows
- IE 11+
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Edge 16

Mobile
- Safari 9+
- Android 6+
- Samsung Browser (latest version)
- Chrome (latest version)

#### Silver Level Support
In these browsers, behavior & design are acceptable, but may not be as originally intended. A user is still able to access all content and functionality as described.

- IE 10 on Windows
- Android 5+
- Safari 7+

#### Bronze Level Support
In these browsers, behavior & design may not be great, but the content doesn't appear "broken" to the user, either. All content is accessible, and functionality is as described. Additional testing may be required during implementation.

- IE 9 on Windows
- Android 4.4+
- Safari 6+
